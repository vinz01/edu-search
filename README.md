An AI powered Chrome extension which enhances the educational experience of the user on YouTube

## The problem Edu-Search solves
In today's digital world, YouTube is one of the main sources of education and learing for users of all generations. NESO Academy, NPTEL, MIT OCW, CS50 among others are the lifelines of us engineers. Come exam time, we all rush to YouTube to learn and revise our concept, but what happens is the videos are too long and we don't know where to can we find that one topic which we want to learn in the video. It is here where Edu-Search comes into the picture. Edu-Search allows the students to search for keywords and go to that point in the video where the keyword is mentioned or talked about. Edu-Search also provides a graphical representation of an ad-hoc entity based sentiment analysis which tells us if the keyword is being said in a positive or negative connotation. It provides with a summary and also allows the user to ask any question and then jump to that part of the video where the answer is being talked about. We believe that Edu-Search is the future of learning and education on YouTube and will change the way we watch YouTube videos in the future.
